## Animation

We can get references for our sprites from:
- [spriters resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)

## Notes for choosing a colour palette:

## Resolution

- for sprites choose a resolution of 64x64

- for map environment, we want our camera to be focused on a 640x360 <-- this seems to be pretty good space to draw in
