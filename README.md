## Notes for choosing a colour palette:


Colour ramps: 
- [color designer](https://colordesigner.io/color-palettes)
- [lospec](https://lospec.com/) - sprites 


Helpful youtube videos on colour palette choice:

colours?
- [paletton](paletton.com) - can create colours that go well together

## Resolution

- for sprites choose a resolution of 64x64

- for map environment, we want our camera to be focused on a 640x360 <-- this seems to be pretty good space to draw in 


## Audio

free sounds?
- [freesound](https://freesound.org/)


## AI

We can use Metas Llama for our AI needs. This [article](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Nov/29/llamafile/) goes over how to download a single file and use it locally. 

Once server executed on machine, we can visit it by going to http://127.0.0.1:8080 and enter a prompt. 

This could be used in our game to do open ended AI dialogue
