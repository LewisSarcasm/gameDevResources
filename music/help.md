You can basically treat them all as 4/4 or 2/2, so nothing should be jarring metrically speaking. As for the rest, here's what I found:

Strolling: Ab Major, 120 BPM, full time, straight eighths but swung sixteenths

Skipping: E Major, 79 BPM, half time, triplets/swung eighths

Steady: G Major, 113 BPM, full time, straight eighths with occasional triplet sixteenths

Sunshine: C Major, 78 BPM, half time, straight eighths

Valor: G Major, 112 BPM, full time, triplets/swung eighths with occasional straight eighths

Tension: C Minor, 113 BPM, full time, straight eighths

Excited: F Major, 120 BPM, full time, straight eighths

Mad Dash: G Major, 185 BPM, full time, straight eighths

Party Time: G Major, 123 BPM, full time, straight eighths (row 1) or triplets/swung eighths (rows 2/3)

Rivalry: G Minor, 168 BPM, full time, straight eighths
